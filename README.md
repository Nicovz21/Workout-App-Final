# Workout-App-Final
# Introduction
> Our Workout App is designed to help workout enthusiasts with creating a workout regimen. This is best for newcomers to exercise, but it allows any user to get a workout schedule for their needs. This includes the option to select your preferred use of equipment, preferred number of rest days, and your experience level, either beginner or experienced. The app includes a number of options on its toolbar, including a detailed “help” screen containing useful information as well as a BMI chart for the user to access if they so desire. 
# MySQLiteHelperTest
> This is a test class for testing the database's insertion and accuracy. Using the MySQLiteHelper, a new table is created. A query gets called on this table, querying through each column index and comparing it to the data provided using assertEquals() and assertTrue().
